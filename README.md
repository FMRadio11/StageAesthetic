# StageAesthetic
(The VisionsExpose folder is a leftover from when this was a joke hack. This hack makes no changes to either Visions of Heresy or Expose - not intentionally, at least)
## OVERVIEW
- All normal stages except for Commencement and the Stage 4s (so not including any Hidden Realms or other stages that don't advance the stage count once you clear them) will roll for either vanilla or one of two alts. The Stage 4s only have one alt each, as you'd pick between three of them normally.
- If an alt is selected, the stage's post-processing (mostly just RampFog, but a couple of them also mess with ColorGrading) will be altered to give the stage a slightly different appearance. For example, Titanic Plains can either have a bluer appearance with a darker sky (similar to the console launch trailer, except it isn't overcast), or something resembling the sunset you see in one of the PC trailers.
- Adds in Artifact of Seasons (unlocked by default for now; I'd like to tie it to Artifact Reliquary later on). If enabled, all alts will replace some of their enemies with ones more appropriate to the new color scheme; for example, the blue alt for Titanic Plains switches the spawning of Jellyfish and Lesser Wisps, and can spawn Magma Worm instead of Wandering Vagrant if your stage count is 3 or higher.
- I'm not sure if it works yet, but Artifact of Seasons should? also add Shrine of the Woods to the spawn pool. Wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't, though...

## KNOWN ISSUES
- Haven't had a chance to test it yet, but Kin and Dissonance will probably break with this
- I'm not sure if this mod causes it, but some monsters throw a lot of errors (Grandparent in particular will occasionally cause heavy lag with M2)
- Starstorm 2's storm effects are incompatible with this mod atm, they override the RampFog effect I use

## TODO
- Create alts for Commencement, Artifact Reliquary, and possibly Gilded Coast
- Figure out what the heck Forgotten Haven does to see if compatibility is possible
- Add rain effects once I figure out how tf SobelRain works
- Add support for Starstorm 2's Void event since its effects collide with this mod
- Add support for other enemy mods if possible, mostly Archaic/Ancient Wisp
- Figure out what this does for family events, fix issues if they come up
- Maybe add unused monsters and regional variants
- Maybe add events for Bloody Mist Roost/Grove and other unusual stages
